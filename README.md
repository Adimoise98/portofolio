This is my first-ever project built with Next.js and TailwindCSS, marking an exciting milestone in my development journey. The website serves as a platform to present my skills, experience, and projects to future employers in a professional and visually engaging manner. 

Throughout this project, I explored the powerful features of Next.js, such as server-side rendering and routing, alongside the versatility of TailwindCSS for crafting responsive and modern designs. I followed an online tutorial to establish a solid foundation while tailoring the layout and functionality to reflect my unique personal brand. 

The portfolio not only highlights my technical abilities but also demonstrates my enthusiasm for learning and implementing new tools in real-world projects.
